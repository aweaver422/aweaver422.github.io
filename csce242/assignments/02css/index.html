                    <p>Harry Potter is a popular middle-grade fantasy book series about a young wizard and the challenges he faces to free the wizarding world from the hands of the dark lord. The series was written by author J.K. Rowling, who published the first book of the series in 1997 and the final book in 2007. Harry Potter is one of the largest book franchises in the world, and continues to grow as more stories and merchandise are released every year.</p>

                    <p>Harry James Potter (the character) was born to Lily and James Potter on July 31st, 1980. During his infancy, his parents were murdered by the dark Lord Voldemort. Voldemort attempted to kill Harry the same way, but miraculously Harry survived the curse. The boy was then moved to his aunt and uncle's house, where he endured abuse for years. When his eleventh birthday rolled around, he was introduced to the wizarding world and enrolled at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. For the entirety of his school career, the boy was tormented by Voldemort and witnessed many of his friends, family, and mentors die in the process. </p>

                    <p>Many people praise the professors that oversaw Harry's education throughout the series. Some professors, such as McGonagall, did a wonderful job in keeping Harry safe and trying to ensure his life was as good as it could possibly be. However, some characters are overlooked in their actions and put on a high pedestal. Dumbledore and Snape do not deserve any of the love they get from the community, as their actions caused Harry serious stress on his growing mind and forced him into situations he should've never been in.<br><br>For example, Dumbledore did not care about how the Dursleys, Harry's aunt and uncle, were treating Harry. Yes, the Dursleys had sort of magical protection due to Harry's mom's sacrifice, that did not give Dumbledore the right to just let Harry endure the treatment from them. Could the Dursleys really not have been scared into taking better care of Harry? Hagrid giving their son Dudley a pig tail sure did, so it probably wouldn't have taken much.<br><br>Another terrible professor was Severus Snape. Sure, by the end of the book he was kind of okay, but there was absolutely no excuse for how Snape treated Harry at the beginning of the series. Just because Harry looked like his father--who Snape hated--does not mean Snape could bully a literal child. For someone who cared a lot for Lily Potter, he sure didn't show it in the way he treated Harry Potter. Just image how Lily would react if she knew her best friend was mentally beating up her son...</p>

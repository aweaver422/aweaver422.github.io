        <p>Warriors, or better known as Warrior Cats, is a fictional novel series based on the tales and adventures of feral cats. Written by Erin Hunter, it was first published in January of 2003 and continues to have new editions released year after year. Although aimed towards middle grade readers, many young adults and older readers have taken a liking to the books due to the intense drama each arc brings to the storyline. As of August 2025, there are over 120 published books. </p>
